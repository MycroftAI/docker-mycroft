# Mycroft Docker Development Environment

### How to build and run

1. Git pull this repository - ```git clone https://github.com/MycroftAI/docker-mycroft.git```

2. Build the docker image with 
   ```docker build -t <yourusername>/mycroft .``` in the directory that you have checked out.

3. If you would rather have an interactive session (for testing, coding, or whatever) with the docker container, start the container with 
   ```docker run --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd --privileged -it <youruser>/mycroft /bin/bash```
   
4. Now you can run /mycroft/ai/mycroft.sh  to start up the service, and then run cli to test it.  The available syntax for this command is:

```
Quickly start, stop or restart Mycroft's esential services in detached screens
